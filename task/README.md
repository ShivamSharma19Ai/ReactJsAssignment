# Kanban Board

The Kanban Board Task Management System is a React-based web application that provides a visual and organized way for teams to manage their tasks efficiently. Inspired by the Kanban methodology, the system allows users to create, assign, and track tasks through different stages of completion, providing a real-time collaborative environment for teams.

# Key Features

### Task Creation and Assignment

Users can create tasks with details such as title, description, priority, and assigned user.
Tasks are organized into different status categories, including "Todo," "In Progress," "Done," and more.

### Grouping and Sorting

The system supports three distinct ways to group tasks: by status, by user, and by priority.
Users can also sort tasks based on priority and title, providing flexibility in task organization.

### Persisting User View State

The application saves the user's preferred grouping and sorting options, maintaining the view state even after page reload.

### Real-time Updates

Changes made by one user, such as task assignment or status update, are instantly reflected for all team members.
